Download this whole folder somewhere on your computer (keep the structure as shown).

Start the little server:

Open a terminal(win+R --> type cmd --> enter):

cd ws-dom-controller/server
npm install
npm start


You should see:
Listening on ws://localhost:8765

Load the Chrome extension:

Open Chrome → type chrome://extensions → Enter

Top-right: turn on Developer mode

Click Load unpacked

Select the folder: ws-dom-controller/extension

You’ll see “WS DOM Controller” appear. That’s it.

Watch them talk:

The extension auto-connects to the server.

In the server terminal you’ll see the extension say hello.

The server sends a short demo: opens https://example.org, checks <h1>, gets HTML, prints page title.

Try your own commands:

In the server terminal, type a single-line JSON and press Enter:

Open Google:

{"cmd":"nav","url":"https://google.com"}


Type into Google’s search box and press Enter:

{"cmd":"type","selector":"textarea[name='q'],input[name='q']","text":"federated learning","enter":true,"timeout_ms":5000}}


Click the first result link:

{"cmd":"click","selector":"a h3","index":0,"timeout_ms":3000}


Check if a footer exists:

{"cmd":"exists","selector":"footer"}


Get the whole page’s HTML (will truncate if gigantic):

{"cmd":"get_html"}


Run JavaScript and get the value:

{"cmd":"exec_js","js":"document.title"}


If you see an error about not finding an element, the selector might not match that page. Try exists first to confirm.
